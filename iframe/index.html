        <div class="box3">Time is the most valuable thing in life. It has no beginning and no end. It can neither be created nor be destroyed. Time is the only dimension in which we all live our lives, and it affects everything that we do, from a flower's growing cycle to the destruction of empires. Time is so important, in fact, that if you did not have any, you could not do anything at all. There are many things that we can do with our time: We can spend it on leisure activities, such as sleeping, watching TV, reading or going for a walk; on work or study; on raising a family; or on helping others. No matter what we choose to do, it is important that we manage our time and make the most of it. Time is a valuable thing when we are in school.It can neither be created nor be destroyed. Time is the only dimension in which we all live our lives, and it affects everything that we do, from a flower's growing cycle.</div>
